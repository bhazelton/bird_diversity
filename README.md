# bird_diversity

An example repo for a bird diversity experiment.

This example is based on a classic ecology paper that uses Shannon Entropy
(also called Shannon Index in ecology) as a measure of diversity of bird and
plant species and of foliage cover at different heights to address the question:
"What is it about the environment which controls the bird species diversity?"

The original paper is:
MacArthur, R.H. and MacArthur, J.W. (1961), On Bird Species Diversity. Ecology, 42: 594-598. https://doi.org/10.2307/1932254

In our example, we are interested in replicating this experiment, so we have
gathered data from a number of test sites across the US.
