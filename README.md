# bird_diversity

An example repo for a bird diversity experiment.

This example is based on a classic ecology paper that uses Shannon Entropy
(also called Shannon Index in ecology) as a measure of diversity of bird and
plant species and of foliage cover at different heights to address the question:
"What is it about the environment which controls the bird species diversity?"

The original paper is:
MacArthur, R.H. and MacArthur, J.W. (1961), On Bird Species Diversity. Ecology, 42: 594-598. https://doi.org/10.2307/1932254

In our example, we are interested in replicating this experiment, so we have
gathered data from a number of test sites across the US.

## git hash based version number

This package uses setuptools_scm to set the version number of the package equal
based on the git hash. To get the version number (which contains the hash) use:
```
import bird_diversity
version = bird_diversity.__version__
```

Then the `version` variable will contain a version string, something like:
```
'0.1.dev2+g81f125f92.d20260204'
```
The part after the `+g` is the git hash (N.B. the "g" is not part of the hash).
If there is anything after the hash (e.g. `.d20260204` in this example) it means
that there are local changes that are not included in a commit.
There will be no `+g` if you are on a tagged version because the tag fully
specifies the commit. 


## testing

To run tests, you must first create a conda environment with the required
packages Use:
`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

Next install the bird_diversity package with pip. Use:
`pip install --no-deps -e .`

(The option `--no-deps` tells pip not to install the dependencies, something we want to do because we manage our dependencies with conda, not pip. The option `-e` makes this an editable install so that if you change you don't have to reinstall to run the modified code.)

You can run the tests in the `tests` directory with:
`pytest`

A few things to note:
1. It is important to have an installable package, with an `__init__.py` file in the package directory and a `pyproject.toml`.
2. You must install the package to be able to run the tests.
3. Both the test files and the test functions must start with `test_` for pytest to find them.
4. In the test files do not use relative imports.
